# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Overview of Citibike Analysis
I was tasked with creating some visualizations based of data retreived from the NYC Citibike program. In doing so, I created 7 different
visualizations, each aimed at different aspects of the data that was collected. A major key was looking at the breakdown of trip duration,
trip timing, volume, and frequencies from customers/subscribers based on gender.
## Results

Based off the following images, the female userbase is 588,431, the male userbase is 1,530,272, and the unknown users is 225,521.

There is a peak of users have trips of of around 10 minutes only, with over 140,00 bikes being taken out for only that long.

This trend seems to carry over to when carried over and viewed for both male and female users, with the breakdown being 100k+ for male users, and 30k plus for female users.

This image shows the frequency of usage for each bikeid, which will help in determining if any of the citibikes need repairwork done.

Based on the image above, it appears that there are heavy peaks of bike usage between 5 and 7pm throughout the weekdays.

Splitting by gender, you can see similar peaks at the same time, although this is slightly affected in the heatmap by the lower volume
of female users.

The split between customer and subscribers follows a similar trend that was shown before, where regardless of the volume gap between 
male and female users, there are similar corresponding increases in subscriber users versus customer users.

## Summary
Based on the visualizations that were finished, it seemed that there was a massive gap between the usage of Citibike between female and 
male users. However, controlling for that based off of volume, it seemed that there were similar utilization periods and durations between
the two genders. Both the line graph that showed how long the users checked out the citibike, as well as how many trips were taken out 
during different periods of the day showed that although volume was much lower, there were similar peaks in activity for male and female
users. Two additional visualizations that I would like to include to further analyse this position one to display where rides started for
male and female riders, as well as a visualization to see where rides ended. This would give a better idea of the demographics of certain
areas that were more heavily frequented.
